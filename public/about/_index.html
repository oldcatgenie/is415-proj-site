<h2>What is this project about?</h2>
<p>LandMarkdown is a project that focuses on the role geospatial analytics can play in real-world situations. In this project, the LandMarkdown project team members apply the geospatial analysis techniques, such as spatial point pattern analysis and spatial autocorrelation, on businesses registered on <a href="https://www.acra.gov.sg/">Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)</a> in Singapore. The analyses will be performed using the R programming language, and some R packages will also be used for this project.</p>
<p>In addition, we will be publishing an R Shiny application so that users are able to visualise the results of the analyses , and also to observe the differences in the analysis by tweaking certain parameters by themselves.</p>
